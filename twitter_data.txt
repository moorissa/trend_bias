Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner says Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions are more fun in Cleveland https://t.co/yawlorbXj6
本家ローリングストーンはハードロックやメタル、エモや能天気パンク、産業ロックといった日本の馬鹿がいうところの「ロック」という一番ダサいもんを軽蔑してるのに、なぜ日本版は自称「ロック」の糞ダサいもんばかりとりあげるんですか？ｗロック（笑）ロック（笑）ってアホか。全く恥ずかしい
ミスチル（笑）アルフィー（笑）小室（笑）コブクロ（笑）パク春（笑）ASKA（笑）談志（笑）吉川晃司（笑）長淵（笑）矢沢（笑）・・・いったい何なんだよこのギャグみたいな糞以下の恥ずかしいメンツ（笑）@ rollingstonejp
RT @joecimperman: Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner says @rockhall inductions are more fun in #Cleveland #ofcoursetheyarewearereal  https://t.co/…
何で日本って何もかもがこうなっちまうんだろうね。情けなくて恥ずかしくて涙が出てくるぜ全く。史上最低の糞雑誌め。@ rollingstonejp
ロック史上最大の巨人、アメリカという国そのもののアイコン、もちろん本家ローリングストーン誌にとっても大看板アーティストBob Dylanに対して盗作問題を突っ込んだ本家に対して、片や日本のパクリ芸人佐野パク春ごときをヨイショで持ち上げる日本版。@ rollingstonejp
日本史上、世界史上最低の糞雑誌ローリングストーン日本版をなんとか廃刊に追い込む方法はないものか・・・@ rollingstonejp
例え日本版のアホ編集者どもがこれまで読んでこなくても、今現在は本家の翻訳記事も載せたり同誌に目を通してるだろうに、なんでこんな軽薄で恥ずかしいジャーナリズムの欠片もねえ中身からっぽの糞雑誌を作っちまうんだろうね。本当にコイツラの神経がわからない。@ rollingstonejp
それにしたって世界中のミュージシャン、音楽ファン、音楽史に燦然と輝くRollingStoneの名前がこの国ではセンスの欠片もねえ糞業界人どもによってギャグみたいな存在にされちまってるなんて悲しすぎるじゃねかよ @ rollingstonejp
ほんと音楽の「お」の字も知らない馬鹿日本人がやってるんだろうな。よくヤンウェナーも怒らねえもんだ。まあ世界とは無縁の極東の島国ガラパゴスドメスティックパクリギャグ芸人のことなど1ミリも知らないから無理もないが@ rollingstonejp
しかし佐野パク春とローリングストーン日本版ってこれほどお似合いというか 。最悪の糞みたいな組み合わせもねえよな。アメリカ発の文化をなんでもダサく薄っぺらく矮小化してしまう日本的なるものの典型みたいな組み合わせ。@ rollingstonejp
とにかく今まで本家RollingStoneなど全く読んでこなかった同誌に思い入れの欠片もねえ連中がローリングストーンの名を日本でギャグみたいに貶めてることに腹が立つ。@ rollingstonejp
しかしローリングストーン日本版が廃刊にならない理由がわからない。全く売れてないのは明らかだし。セブン＆アイ出版なんつうデカい出版社（音楽やカルチャーとは無縁の）だから赤字でも海外ブランドの雑誌をやってます的なイメージがほしいだけなんだろうな。@ rollingstonejp
